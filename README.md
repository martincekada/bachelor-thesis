## Application of Constructive Optimization Algorithm On Student Scheduling
This thesis describes few optimization algorithms. Description of Generalized Cross-Entropy Optimization Algorithm is given afterwards.
There is a formal specification of the scheduling problem for laboratory exercises on Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing.
Described Generalized Cross-Entropy Optimization Algorithm is implemented and applied to specified problem. Algorithm input is structured representation
of students schedules and laboratory exercises and output is students schedules. The algorithm is analyzed and influence of various parameters is presented.

Keywords: optimization problems, scheduling problems, Cross-Entropy Optimization Algorithm.
